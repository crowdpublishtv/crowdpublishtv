<!--Notes: 

The erb for the panel-heading needs to be changed. Can't remember how to insert current page's username.

Need to import the calendar of upcoming events but only show streams hosted by this user. The header badge should count and display how many of these events there are.

Do I call them Streams or Discussions?
