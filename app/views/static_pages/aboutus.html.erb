      What is CrowdPublish.TV 
    </div ><br>
    <div class="font19left" >
      A place for authors, videographers, and other storytellers to earn financial support from fans to create stories about Classy Characters; a place to find and offer support for stories about characters we'd like to see more of in society. Fiction, nonfiction, books, articles, short stories, documentaries, movies, short video clips, video games - all types of storytelling are welcome as long as they showcase characters who make the world a better place. <br><br>

      Fans benefit by receiving items beyond just books and movies - storytellers offer the opportunity for fans to engage with storytellers via social media or other methods, sneak preview access, and any other unique items that only the storytellers can offer. CrowdPublish.TV helps storytellers come up with a list of suggested <%= link_to "Perks to offer fans", "/suggestedperks" %>.

    </div ><br>
    <div class="font19left">
      <%= link_to "Lisa Schaefer", '/lisa' %> earned her Ph.D. in systems engineering at Arizona State University, was a research engineer at a think tank in Washington, DC, and taught engineering courses at several universities.
      <br><br>

      Dr. Schaefer is the writer-producer of Lisa's 80s Catholic High School Movie and Budget Justified: The Waste, Fraud & Abuse of Government Workers. She encourages society to create more stories about everyday leaders, especially women in tech. She created CrowdPublish.TV so other storytellers could grow their businesses selling the antithesis to people who are famous for being famous. Dr. Schaefer intends that CrowdPublish.TV will become a platform where livestreaming discussions with storytellers can be found 24 hours a day.
