      What is CrowdPublish.TV 
    </div ><br>
    <div class="font19left" >
      A place for authors, videographers, and other storytellers to earn financial support from fans to create stories about Respectable Characters; a place to find and offer support for stories about characters we'd like to see more of in society. Fiction, nonfiction, books, articles, short stories, documentaries, movies, short video clips, video games - all types of storytelling are welcome as long as they showcase characters who make the world a better place. <br><br>

      Fans benefit by receiving items beyond just books and movies - storytellers offer the opportunity for fans to engage with storytellers via social media or other methods, sneak preview access, and any other unique items that only the storytellers can offer. CrowdPublish.TV helps storytellers come up with a list of suggested <%= link_to "Perks to offer fans", "/suggestedperks" %>.

      About the founder 
    </div ><br>
    <div class="font19left" >
      After completing her Ph.D. in systems engineering, <%= link_to "Lisa Schaefer", '/lisa' %> was a research engineer at a federal contractor where management created videos about research they didn't do, in efforts to fool the government into giving the company more of your taxpayer money. So she took video production courses to produce stories about what was really going on in government offices from the perspective of a woman engineer.<br><br>

      Dr. Schaefer wanted society to encourage more stories about tech women and other role models - the antithesis to the bombardment of media glorifying vapid people who were famous for being famous - and to discourage trollish porn that often appears on self-publishing platforms. She created CrowdPublish.TV so other storytellers could have a platform where they were not beholden to the limited, predatory business options that were available and where they had the potential to free themselves from dysfunctional employment situations.<br><br> 

      Dr. Schaefer intends that CrowdPublish.TV will become a platform where enlightening livestreaming discussions with storytellers can be found 24 hours a day. Where storytellers can grow a business selling and spreading ideas along with tangible goods to their loyal fanbase, without dependence on an employer who may not embrace their message.<br><br>

      CrowdPublish.TV is a member of the ASU Venture Devils program.
