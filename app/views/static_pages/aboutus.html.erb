    Our Story
  </h1>
    <p class = "black" id="appContent3">
      Back when ThinQ.tv Founder, Dr. Lisa Schaefer, lived in Washington, DC, she attended a meeting where Biz Stone, the founder of Twitter, spoke. All she could thinQ of during the entire meeting was, "I can come up with something better."<br><br>

      Years earlier, Dr. Schaefer had a vision for multi-location party with hundreds of intellectual conversations to drop in to and discovered live-streaming in its early days. "This changes everything," she thought. Anyone with a computer, webcam, and internet connection can communicate with anyone with anyone else who has an internet connection.<br><br>

      Dr. Schaefer developed her own web platform, embedded video chat, and experimented with talk show formats. Most were awful. People wanted to talk at the internet without listening to others in a dialogue. However the thought-provoking conversations that followed were worth coming back for.<br><br>

      When COVID19 hit, college students and parents gathered on ThinQ.tv to talk about substantive topics such as feminism and Black Lives Matter. Anyone is welcome to drop in to any conversation to find out what we're up to - come to share ideas, collaborate on learning, and raise money for your education and your causes. <br><br>
