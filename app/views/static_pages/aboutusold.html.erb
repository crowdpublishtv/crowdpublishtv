      Why we created CrowdPublish.TV 
    </div ><br>
    <div class="font19left" >
      Lisa Schaefer had been attending a writers workshop run by a former president of the Mystery Writers of America mid-Atlantic chapter. The workshop leader really knew her craft and her business. One thing she said that stuck with Dr. Schaefer was, "It's your art, but their business," referring to publishers. But Dr. Schaefer wasn't writing stories to serve the business of publishers, she was serving women and men who needed to hear stories about female engineers. It was <i>her</i> business. And she knew other authors wanted more options to be in charge of their business also. <br><br>

      One day Dr. Schaefer went to a meeting where Biz Stone spoke. As she sat there listening, she thought about how ridiculous twitter was and knew she could come up with something much better. So she decided to learn a new programming language to create something for authors that was better than the limited, predatory business options that were available. <br><br>

      Dr. Schaefer hopes that CrowdPublish.TV will become Interactive Television that provides learning experiences and a culture not dependent on The Man to develop a career, where people are empowered to make an impact on society. <br><br>

      About the founder 
    </div ><br>
    <div class="font19left" >
      <%= link_to "Lisa Schaefer", '/lisa' %> earned her Ph.D. in engineering from Arizona State. She taught statistics classes at Marymount & American Universities and taught Ruby on Rails software engineering at George Mason University. Dr. Schaefer did engineering research at a tech think tank in the Washington, DC, suburbs where contractors and federal employees did more tanking than thinking. <br><br>

      Dr. Schaefer took screenwriting classes from a Hollywood screenwriter and completed graduate level video production courses at American University. She has written books and produced two movies about women in technology: <%= link_to "Budget Justified", '/phases/budgetjustified' %> and <%= link_to "Lisa's 80s Catholic High School Movie", '/movie/1' %>.<br><br>

      Dr. Schaefer lives in Phoenix with her husband of 24 years, her cat, and the two cats next door who think they live with her.
