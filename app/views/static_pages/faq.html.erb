  How is CrowdPublish.TV different than Kickstarter or Patreon? 
</div> 
- Hosting Livestreamed talks and skits gets your fans engaged with your sales page and keeps their attention on your campaign/Perks for an extended period of time.<br>
- CrowdPublish.TV has developed pre-designed Perks, or rewards, to offer fans. These Perks are tailored to actors & authors and their ability to get fans engaged with their work. CrowdPublish.TV Perks also take into consideration ways for your existing fans to get their friends engaged with your work. We are working on automating several forms of engagement, such as social media posting, to make it easier for you to manage engagement content for your fans.<br>
- You can sell downloads directly from CrowdPublish.TV.<br><br>

  Can I use my CrowdPublish.TV page as my website? 
</div> 
Yes. After you sign up on CrowdPublish.TV, add your own photos, videos, writings. Presto, your own web site! Put the url to your CrowdPublish.TV site on your email signature, business cards, social media profile, etc. so your fans can easily contribute funds to your work. <br><br>

<div class = "font26left" >
  Does CrowdPublish.TV fulfill physical items? 
</div> 
No. Like the model of ebay or crowdfunding platforms, creatives are responsible for making sure fans/customers receive what they ordered. Make sure you use these shipments to take advantage of the ability to send fans swag items they'd like to share with their friends, such as stickers, greeting cards with your book cover on the front, or other items that advertise your work. <br><br>
