    ThinQ.tv is a platform where people can host live video fellowship online. It’s similar to having a cocktail party on Zoom. Drop in to a conversation and meet interesting people. <br><br>

    ThinQ.tv breaks the paradigm of “talking at” the internet - where one camera broadcasts live video at a social media platform and expects others to passively observe with little interaction. Instead, ThinQ.tv is for “listening to” people. Unlike Zoom, where you have to be invited to observe a conversation, everyone is welcome to participate in ThinQ.tv fellowship hours - like a Meetup. <br><br>
